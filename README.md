# Recommendation of news articles or blog post to users
Design a recommendation system that can suggest personalized news articles or blog posts to users based on their reading history and interests. The system should be able to learn and adapt to the user's preferences over time and provide relevant and engaging content.

## What is Recommendation system?
Recommendation systems are built to predict what users might like, especially when there are lots of choices available. They can explicitly offer those recommendations to users (e.g., Amazon or Netflix, the classic examples), or they might work behind the scenes to choose which content to surface without giving the user a choice.

Why Recommendation system?
 * Benefits users in finding items of their interest.
 * Help item providers in delivering their items to the right user.
 * Identity products that are most relevant to users.
 *Personalized content.

Help websites to improve user engagement.

## Types of Recommendation Systems.
* Popularity Based Recommendation 
* Classification Mode Based Recommendation 
* Content Based Recommendation
* Collaborative Filtering

## 1. Popularity Based Recommendation:
#### It is a type of recommendation system which works on the principle of popularity and or anything which is in trend. These systems check about the product or movie which are in trend or are most popular among the users and directly recommend those.
  
  #### Merits of popularity based recommendation system:
  * It does not suffer from cold start problems which means on day 1 of the business also it can recommend products on various different filters.
  * There is no need for the user's historical data.

  #### Demerits of popularity based recommendation system:
  * Not personalized. 
  * The system would recommend the same sort of products/movies which are solely based upon popularity to every other user.
  
  #### Example:
  * Google News: News filtered by trending and most popular news.
  * YouTube: Trending videos.
  
## 2. Classification Model
  #### The model that uses features of both products as well as users to predict whether a user will like a product or not.
